We are developing the TradeAgents framework for long horizon task execution based verbal reinforcement learning LLM agents.

Here's the PRD spec for the TradeAgents framework for market research, financial analysis and trading agents:

Product Requirements Document (PRD)

1. Title

TradeAgents: Long-Horizon Task Execution Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning

2. Overview, Goals, and Success Criteria

Overview:
TradeAgents is a SaaS framework for long-horizon task execution using Large Language Models (LLMs). It leverages verbal reinforcement learning (VRL) to enable agents to perform specialized roles such as market research, trading, and financial analysis. The framework promotes adaptive, multi-agent collaboration to address complex financial tasks and decision-making scenarios.

Goals:
	1.	Create specialized LLM-powered agents for tasks like market research, trading, and analysis.
	2.	Implement verbal reinforcement learning for agent self-improvement through episodic updates.
	3.	Enable efficient multi-agent collaboration using modular agent roles.
	4.	Ensure scalability for diverse use cases like portfolio management, trend analysis, and risk management.

Success Criteria:
	•	Agents execute tasks with 20% improvement in efficiency compared to traditional LLM prompts.
	•	90% task accuracy for key outputs (e.g., trend prediction, portfolio recommendations).
	•	Reduced operational cost by minimizing unnecessary peer-to-peer communication.

3. Purpose and Context

Purpose:
To address inefficiencies in long-horizon task execution for financial markets by deploying LLM agents capable of adaptive learning, modular collaboration, and verbal reinforcement for self-improvement.

Context:
Traditional agent systems struggle with complex financial tasks due to high latency in decision-making and limited adaptability. TradeAgents aims to solve these challenges by mimicking the hierarchy and workflows of investment firms, enabling agents to specialize in roles and learn from feedback over long task horizons.

Target Audience:
	•	Hedge funds
	•	Financial analysts
	•	Research firms
	•	Automated trading platforms

Market Context:
Existing financial agent frameworks (e.g., DRL-based systems) lack modularity, adaptability, and real-time learning capabilities. TradeAgents fills this gap by integrating role-based specialization and verbal reinforcement learning.

6. Feature Details

Feature: Verbal Reinforcement Learning (VRL)
	•	UX Flow:
	1.	Agent completes a task and generates a reasoning trajectory.
	2.	Manager agent provides verbal feedback (e.g., “Your prediction lacked consideration of X trend”).
	3.	Analyst agents incorporate feedback and refine prompts for future tasks.
	•	Wireframe Ideas:
A task execution panel with real-time feedback and iterative reasoning updates.
	•	Acceptance Criteria:
	•	Agents must improve decision quality over successive tasks by at least 10%.
	•	Feedback incorporated in less than 5 iterations for a given scenario.

7. Experiments

Hypotheses:
	•	VRL improves task accuracy by enabling episodic self-improvement.
	•	Modular agent roles reduce communication costs and improve task efficiency.

Planned A/B Tests:
	•	Compare task execution with and without VRL.
	•	Test single-agent vs. multi-agent performance for portfolio management tasks.

Metrics:
Task success rate, decision latency, and communication overhead.
